# HashBro
HashBro is a powerful file hashing utility designed for digital forensics and evidence verification. It allows users to compute cryptographic hash values for files, compare hashes to identify matching files, and generate detailed reports for documentation.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Batch Processing**: Hash multiple files or entire folders at once with recursive scanning
- **Evidence Tagging**: Categorize files as "Original" or "Copy" (or custom categories)
- **Automatic Match Detection**: Identify files with matching hash values across all selected algorithms
- **Timezone Support**: Choose between UTC and local time for reports

### Performance & Processing
- **High Performance Optimization**:
  - Parallel processing with dynamic parallelism adjustment

  - **Normal View**: Shows all controls and the data grid
  - **Grid Only View**: Hides controls and shows only the data grid
  - **Collapsed View**: Hides the data grid to save space
  - **Minimal Mode**: Shows only progress info for monitoring long operations

- **Real-time Progress**:
  - File count and completion percentage
  - Processing speed (MB/s)
  - Elapsed time with millisecond precision
  - Animated spinner during processing

- **Console Theme**: Dark theme with green text for a professional appearance

### Reporting & Export
Generate detailed reports in multiple formats:

- Verification statements
- Customizable agency and examiner information

##  System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or newer
- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher
- **Minimum RAM**: 4GB (8GB+ recommended for processing large files)
- **Processor**: Multi-core processor recommended for optimal performance
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for large batch operations

##  Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](../../releases)
2. Run the `setup.exe` file
3. Follow the installation wizard

##  Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Launch SudoCop HashBro
2. Select the hash algorithm(s) you want to use (default is SHA256)
3. Choose evidence type: "Original" or "Copy" (customizable)
4. Add files using one of these methods:
   - Click **"Select Files"** for individual files
   - Click **"Select Folder"** for entire directories (recursive)
   - **Drag and drop** files or folders directly onto the application
5. Files will be processed with real-time progress updates
6. Matching files will be automatically highlighted and marked as "MATCH"

### Case Information
Before generating reports, fill in the case details:
- **Case ID**: Unique identifier for your case
- **Agency**: Your organization or department
- **Examiner**: Person conducting the analysis

### Evidence Type Customization
1. Select either "Original" or "Copy" radio button
2. Click in the adjacent text box to customize the label
3. Enter your preferred description (e.g., "Suspect Device", "Reference Files")

### Timezone Settings
-  Check **"Use UTC Time"** for reports with UTC timestamps
-  Uncheck for local time timestamps
- This setting affects all export formats consistently

### View Modes
- **Grid Only**: Click "View Grid Only" to hide controls and maximize data view
- **Collapsed**: Click "<<" to hide the data grid and save space
- **Minimal Mode**: Click "Min Mode" during processing to see only progress
- **Cancel Operations**: Click "Cancel" to stop processing at any time

### Report Generation
1. Process the files you want to include
2. Click **"Generate Report"**
3. Select your preferred format:
   - **HTML**: Web-based reports (recommended)
   - **Text**: Plain text for easy reading
   - **CSV**: Structured data for analysis
   - **JSON**: Machine-readable format
4. Choose destination and filename
5. Reports include all processed files, hash values, and matches

##  Performance Tips

- **Large Files**: The application automatically optimizes for files over 100MB using memory-mapped files
- **Batch Processing**: For thousands of files, ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: SSD storage significantly improves performance for large batch operations
- **Algorithm Selection**: Using multiple algorithms increases processing time proportionally
- **Parallel Processing**: The application automatically adjusts thread count based on your hardware

##  Error Handling

The application provides detailed error reporting:
- **File Not Found (FNF)**: Missing or moved files
- **Access Error (AE)**: Permission or security issues
- **IO Error (IOE)**: General input/output problems
- **Memory Error (ME)**: Files too large for available memory

Files with errors are:
- Marked with "ERROR" in the grid
- Included in the error analysis section of reports
- Listed with specific error descriptions

##  Advanced Features

### Memory Management
- Intelligent buffer pooling for efficient memory usage
- Garbage collection optimization for large file processing
- Automatic adjustment of buffer sizes based on file types

### File Type Recognition
- Special handling for compressed files (.zip, .rar, .7z, etc.)
- Optimized processing for different file types
- Automatic adjustment of chunk sizes for optimal performance

## Technical Details

### Supported Hash Algorithms
- **MD5**: 128-bit (fast but cryptographically broken)
- **SHA1**: 160-bit (legacy, not recommended for security)
